# **Dynamous Workshops Repository**

Welcome to the official Dynamous Workshops repository! This collection contains all the resources, code samples, and complete implementations from our live workshops and events, exclusively for paying members of the Dynamous community.

All workshop resources are continuously updated with best practices and refinements based on community feedback, platform updates, and as I build out these resources/templates in future workshops.

New workshop resources will be added to this repository within 24 hours of the live workshop event!

## **Support & Questions**

If you have questions about workshop resources or encounter any issues:

* Review the workshop recordings for implementation details
* Join one of the weekly office hour sessions to get support
* Post specific technical questions in the community forum

For workshop recordings (and recordings for any Dynamous event!), you click on past events in the [calendar view in the Dynamous community](https://community.dynamous.ai/events) and the recording for the event will be below the description!
