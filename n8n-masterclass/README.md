# Welcome to the n8n Masterclass! ðŸš€

Here we'll dive into mastering the core concepts for n8n and building AI agents within it so you can feel confident getting started no matter what you want to automate!

## What is n8n?

n8n (pronounced "n-eight-n", short for nodenation) is a workflow automation platform that lets you connect apps, services, and APIs together without breaking the bank or your sanity. Think of it as the Swiss Army knife of automation - it does everything you need, and it does it well.

## Why n8n is Different

### ðŸ’° Actually Affordable
n8n is a fraction of the cost of other automation platforms like Zapier and Make.com. Also, you can self-host it on a $5/month server.

### ðŸ”“ Open Source Freedom
n8n is fair-code licensed, meaning you get the source code and can modify it however you want. No vendor lock-in, no surprise pricing changes, very little "sorry, that feature is only in our enterprise plan".

### ðŸ¤– Built for AI Agents
Here's the big one - while other platforms treat AI as an afterthought, n8n was designed with AI agents in mind. You get:
- Native AI agent nodes
- Built-in memory management
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities
- Vector database integrations
- Multi-agent workflows

## Why I Love n8n

- **Flexibility**: Code when you need it, visual when you don't
- **Power**: Handle complex multi-step AI workflows
- **Control**: Self-host to protect your sensitive data

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this session, you'll know how to:
- Navigate n8n like a pro
- Build workflows that actually solve real problems
- Create AI agents that can access your data
- Set up RAG systems that don't hallucinate
